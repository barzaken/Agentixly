# Dominate the Generative Web: How to Be Everywhere at Once

The search landscape used to be a monopoly. Today, it is an ecosystem.
Your customers are scattered across ChatGPT, Google's AI Overviews, Bing Chat, and specialized tools like Perplexity.

For a business, this presents a massive challenge: **How do you ensure accurate, positive coverage across all these AI platforms simultaneously?**

The answer is **Scalable GEO (Generative Engine Optimization).**

## The "Citation Economy"

In the world of AI, currency is **citations**.
The more credible sources that mention your business, and the better structured your own data is, the more likely an AI is to "learn" about you and recommend you.

But manually optimizing for this is impossible. You cannot write enough content or code enough schema markup by hand to feed these hungry engines.
