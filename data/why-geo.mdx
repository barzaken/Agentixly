# From Keywords to Citations: Why GEO Is the New SEO

For two decades, the goal was simple: rank #1 on Google.
But in 2025, user behavior has shifted. Millions of people are no longer "searching"—they are **asking**.

They ask ChatGPT for advice. They ask Perplexity for comparisons. They ask Gemini for recommendations.

In this new reality, ranking #1 isn't enough. You need to be the **cited source** in the AI's answer.

This is **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**.

## The Shift: Ranking vs. Recommending

Traditional SEO was about convincing an algorithm to show your link.
GEO is about convincing a Large Language Model (LLM) that you are the **ultimate authority**.

When an AI answers a user, it synthesizes data from trusted sources. If you aren't optimized for GEO, the AI simply ignores you.

> **The Goal:** Don't just get found. Get *recommended*.

## How to Become the "AI's Choice"

AI engines favor content that is:
1.  **Authoritative:** Backed by clear expertise and data.
2.  **Structured:** Formatted in a way machines can easily parse (lists, direct answers, schema).
3.  **Comprehensive:** Covering topics in depth so the AI doesn't need to look elsewhere.
